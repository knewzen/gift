<h1>Step-1 Setup a wallet</h1>

	<p>The Bitcoin wallet is simply a pair of public address and a private key.
	The public key is to be shared to recieve Bitcoins same as we share our 	email-id to recieve emails.The private key needs to be kept safe and 		secret.You can access your Bitcoins on your address by the private key.</p>

	<p>Be mindful of the fact that unlike in the case of websites like Facebook, 		Gmail where you have the option to regenrate the password by choosing "Forgot 		Password" option. In Bitcoins you cannot regenerate the private key if you 		lose it once.Because Bitcoin is not a company which would keep back up 		of the private key. You are fully responsible to keep your private keys safe 		and secured.</p>

	<p>To create a brand new Bitcoin wallet,</p> 

	<p>Download Blockchain app</p> 
	Remember to safely save the "recovery phrase" provided at the time of sign up.
	This is required to retrieve the wallet when you reinstall the app or change 		the phone. If you lose this phrase, then you can never restore your wallet if 		the app gets deleted from the phone or the phone is lost.

	Other option for a mobile wallet is Bread Wallet. It has a very user friendly 		UI.
